# Skittermouse — Unimplemented Work

Derived from [spec.md](spec.md); section refs (§) point there. This file lists **only what
is not yet built** — as each item lands, delete it from here.

## Status

- Native C++ only (product), **878 checks green**, Windows + macOS CI green at every commit.
- **The full app loop is validated headlessly in-process** by the mocked-systems e2e set
  (`tests/e2e_full_system_tests.cpp` + `tests/mock_systems.h`): every OS boundary is faked
  (MockInjector, MockClipboard, an in-process network Switchboard) so pairing → stored PSK →
  ConnectionService dial/accept → AES-256-GCM secure link → mesh switch → forwarded input reaching
  the injector → clipboard sync all run in one process. The mocks live ONLY in `tests/`, never in
  the product exe.
- **The entire data plane is validated over real TCP** by a two-container Docker rig
  (`tests/docker/`, run `pwsh tests/docker/run.ps1`): (1) ECDH numeric-comparison **pairing** →
  both nodes derive the same 6-digit code + PSK; (2) **encrypted input** — secure link →
  coordinator election → ownership switch → a forwarded keystroke decrypted + injected; (3)
  **file transfer** — a 500 KB file chunked → reassembled by offset → byte-verified. All exercise
  the SAME product logic (secure_link → ConnectionService/ConnectionManager → MeshNode →
  EncryptedTransport / FileChannel) over the real POSIX WS transport.
- Implemented + unit-tested: all core logic + crypto (AES-256-GCM / ECDH P-256 / SHA / HMAC /
  HKDF / base64, KAT-verified), pairing + secure-link handshake, the protocol/codec layer, the
  mesh brain (N-peer switch, coordinator failover, heartbeat fail-safe, clipboard sync, input
  forwarding, one-time drop/return/unavailable/version toasts), `ConnectionService`, the
  file-transfer session + `FileChannel`, WoL `WakeFlow`, and the config store. Both Windows
  (Shell_NotifyIcon) and macOS (NSStatusBar) are real tray apps; the Windows tray has the mesh,
  hotkey+fallback, picker, clipboard, WoL, an opt-in run-on-startup toggle, a working Settings
  item, **auto-discovery pairing** (LAN beacon → pick device by name+IP, no manual IP typing),
  **native file copy/paste** (delay-render IDataObject → on-demand encrypted /files channel), and
  a **file debug log** (`%APPDATA%\Skittermouse\log.txt`); macOS has the Carbon hotkey + NSPanel
  picker. **Windows WS transport is now wss (Schannel TLS)**; POSIX WS transport for macOS/Linux.
- Remaining items are **macOS-only** (see the **macOS** section below); the **Windows product is
  feature-complete**. Two field bugs were just fixed + CI-green:
  (1) one-way discovery when a **VPN** is up — the beacon now sends to every interface's directed
  broadcast, so the LAN NIC is always covered regardless of the default route; (2) the installer
  now opens the app's firewall ports, stops a running instance before reinstall, and the app has a
  single-instance guard so two copies never fight over the fixed ports.

---

## VERY IMPORTANT — native C++ only (product); OpenSSL only in the Linux test rig

Every SHIPPED item must use **native, system-provided C++ APIs only** — Win32, WinSock2,
CNG/BCrypt, Schannel, Core Graphics, AppKit, CommonCrypto, Security.framework, BSD sockets, and
the C++ standard library. **No third-party dependencies in the product** (spec §16). The ONE
exception is `src/platform/crypto_posix.cpp` + `tools/net*.cpp`: they link OpenSSL, but they are
the Linux two-container TEST RIG only (`tests/docker/`) and are never compiled into the
Windows/macOS product (guarded by the CMake `else()`/`UNIX AND NOT APPLE` branches).

---

## Remaining — cross-platform / Windows

The four items below are addressed in code + CI-green; what's left is your on-hardware confirmation.

### Run-after-install — FIXED (verify on a clean PC)

- Root cause was almost certainly the **missing Visual C++ redistributable** on a fresh PC: the exe
  was built with the dynamic runtime (`/MD`) so it needed `VCRUNTIME140.dll` / `MSVCP140.dll`. It is
  now built with the **static runtime (`/MT`)** — `dumpbin /dependents` confirms the exe imports
  ONLY system DLLs, so it launches on a clean Windows machine with nothing preinstalled. Startup is
  logged before any early-return (`[app] runTrayApp entry`, or `another instance already running`),
  so a "nothing happened after Finish" is now diagnosable from `%APPDATA%\Skittermouse\log.txt`. A
  single-instance guard + kill-the-running-instance-before-reinstall keep a zombie from blocking it.

### One-way LAN discovery (VPN) — FIXED (verify corp ↔ home)

- The beacon now opens a socket **bound to each interface's own IP** and sends to that NIC's subnet
  broadcast + the limited broadcast, forcing it out every adapter — a VPN owning the default route
  can no longer swallow it. The installer also adds **outbound** firewall rules (UDP 47802 / TCP
  47800-47803) alongside the inbound ones. If a corp/endpoint firewall still blocks the app's
  outbound UDP by policy, that's the remaining variable (allow Skittermouse manually there).

### Full-repo audit — DONE

- Line-by-line audit of the resource-management / security-sensitive code. Fixed: a message-decoder
  **length guard** (reject an implausible/hostile `payload_length` before the `size_t` add or a huge
  allocation), **PSK zeroization** (`crypto::secureZero` wipes decrypted key material on every exit
  of the key store), and macOS transport **keychain + SSL cleanup** on every failure/early-return
  path. Reviewed-and-already-safe items (the discovery-socket close, the HGLOBAL null-check, the ECC
  blob init) were confirmed clean. A regression test locks in the decoder guard.

### Test coverage — tooling + CI + 97.7% of the portable code

- `SM_COVERAGE` CMake option + a **Coverage CI job** (`.github/workflows/coverage.yml`, ubuntu +
  gcovr) measure the portable, headless-testable code: now **97.7% lines / 99.6% functions** (added
  tests for the file logger, the discovery/WoL UDP sockets, and the pairing error paths). Literal
  100% line coverage isn't reachable here: the remaining ~40 lines are crypto (OpenSSL) and socket
  **error branches** needing artificial failure injection, plus unreachable defensive guards; and
  the OS glue (Win32 COM / Schannel / Cocoa / SecureTransport) isn't compiled on the Linux coverage
  host — it's validated by the Windows/macOS CI build, the Docker network rig, and on hardware. The
  CI job publishes the figure on every push so regressions are caught.

### Lock-screen unlock — runtime open question (§14)

- Unlock is switch-then-type only (no scripted credentials). **Verify on a real locked Windows
  machine** whether `SendInput`-forwarded keystrokes cross the Secure Desktop / `LogonUI`
  boundary; if they don't, unlock needs physical presence at that machine (an OS limitation, not a
  bug). `lock_win` / `lock_mac`, autostart, and the WoL "Waking…" flow are all done.

---

## macOS — needs a Mac to write + validate against the live Cocoa/keychain runtime

Everything _above_ the transport (mesh, pairing, discovery, file channel, clipboard, WoL,
election) is cross-platform and already unit-tested + Docker-proven; only the macOS OS-glue below
remains. The Windows side interops only over `wss`, so all of this must speak TLS.

**Landed (compiles on macOS CI):** `platform/ws_transport_mac.mm` — a native BSD-socket +
SecureTransport `wss` transport mirroring the validated OpenSSL/Schannel structure. Its hardest
piece, minting the ephemeral self-signed server identity, rests on `crypto/x509_selfsigned` — a
pure-logic DER cert builder **unit-tested and byte-verified on Windows** (CryptoAPI parses AND
self-verifies its output), so the cert bytes SecureTransport consumes are known-correct.

- [~] `platform/ws_transport_mac.mm` — validate the SecureTransport/keychain runtime path
  (SecKeyCreateRandomKey / temporary keychain / SecIdentityCreateWithCertificate / SSLHandshake)
  on a real Mac. Compiles on CI; same footing Schannel had before its two-machine run.
- [ ] Tray networking in `platform/tray_mac.mm`: background connect/accept → secure-link → mesh
      I/O thread, the NSTimer mesh pump, auto-discovery + the `NSAlert` pairing confirm — a direct
      port of the done Windows tray. `ConnectionManager` / `MeshNode` / `secure_link` /
      `PairingExchange` / discovery are all cross-platform + tested; only the Cocoa threading/UI
      glue is new.
- [ ] `platform/filepromise_mac.mm` (`NSFilePromiseProvider`) — native Finder progress (§9.2). The
      mesh announce, the `/files` secure channel, and `net/FileChannel` are cross-platform + done;
      only the macOS OS-provider glue remains.

## Manual validation

The code is built + CI-green, but these paths need real hardware — validate on your machines.

### Two Windows machines — pair, connect, forward input (Step 9, built)

1. Install the same nightly on both PCs; both show the tray icon.
2. Same LAN. The installer now **auto-adds the Windows Firewall rules** (TCP 47800-47803, UDP
   47802); on a corp/domain PC where policy blocks that, allow Skittermouse manually.
3. On BOTH PCs: tray → **Add device**. Each PC broadcasts its presence (now out **every** network
   interface, so a VPN on one PC no longer hides it) and shows a live list of devices (name + IP).
4. On ONE PC, select the other from the list → **Pair**. (The other PC just needs its Add-device
   window open; it accepts automatically.)
5. Both show a **6-digit code** — confirm they MATCH and click Yes on both → toast "Paired with …".
6. Within a few seconds → toast "Connected to <PC>"; the peer appears in the tray menu.
7. Click the peer (or hotkey → pick it) to switch input, then type/move → it appears on the other
   PC; switch back with the hotkey/menu. (This is exactly the flow the Docker rig proves headless.)

- Not connecting? Check the firewall, that both are on the same LAN, and that both run the same
  build. The `%APPDATA%\Skittermouse\log.txt` file logs each dial/accept/pair/TLS step.

### Two Windows machines — copy/paste a file (Step 10, built)

1. Pair + connect two PCs as above; allow TCP 47803 (the /files channel) through the firewall.
2. On PC-A: copy a file (or several) in Explorer (Ctrl+C).
3. On PC-B: paste (Ctrl+V) into any folder → Explorer shows its own copy-progress dialog while the
   bytes stream from PC-A over the encrypted /files channel; the files land byte-for-byte.
4. Mid-transfer failure (e.g. PC-A goes offline) surfaces as Explorer's own native copy-error
   dialog. `log.txt` logs `[file] announced/serving/pulling` on each side.

- Directories are skipped in v1 (files only). One transfer at a time.

### Run-on-startup installer checkbox (Step 13)

- Install with "Run Skittermouse on startup" ticked → after reboot the tray reappears.
- Default (unticked) → no autostart; enable later via tray "Run on startup" or Settings.
- "Run Skittermouse" on the installer's finish page launches it immediately (elevated, from the
  elevated installer). If a previous copy was running, the reinstall now stops it first and the
  single-instance guard prevents two copies fighting over the ports.

### Lock-screen unlock (Step 14, open question)

- Switch to a LOCKED PC and type its password through forwarded input. Verify whether SendInput
  crosses the Secure Desktop (LogonUI) boundary on your Windows build; if not, unlock needs
  physical presence (documented limitation, not a bug).

## Do NOT build (spec §1 non-goals — listed so they aren't accidentally added)

- Linux support in the PRODUCT (the Linux build is a TEST RIG only, never shipped).
- Edge-of-screen crossing as a primary/load-bearing switch trigger.
- Remote desktop, screen streaming, video capture.
- A Bluetooth backend now (keep only the `transport.h` abstraction).

## Evaluate the below - don't implement yet

- Rich clipboard formats (images/RTF/HTML) — plain text only v1.
- Resumable/queued file transfers — one at a time, fail cleanly.
- Any unattended/scripted credential injection into a lock screen.

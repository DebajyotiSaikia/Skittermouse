# Skittermouse — Unimplemented Work

Derived from [spec.md](spec.md); section refs (§) point there. This file lists **only what
is not yet built** — as each item lands, delete it from here.

## Status

- Native C++ only (product), **878 checks green**, Windows + macOS CI green at every commit.
- **The full app loop is validated headlessly in-process** by the mocked-systems e2e set
  (`tests/e2e_full_system_tests.cpp` + `tests/mock_systems.h`): every OS boundary is faked
  (MockInjector, MockClipboard, an in-process network Switchboard) so pairing → stored PSK →
  ConnectionService dial/accept → AES-256-GCM secure link → mesh switch → forwarded input reaching
  the injector → clipboard sync all run in one process. The mocks live ONLY in `tests/`, never in
  the product exe.
- **The entire data plane is validated over real TCP** by a two-container Docker rig
  (`tests/docker/`, run `pwsh tests/docker/run.ps1`): (1) ECDH numeric-comparison **pairing** →
  both nodes derive the same 6-digit code + PSK; (2) **encrypted input** — secure link →
  coordinator election → ownership switch → a forwarded keystroke decrypted + injected; (3)
  **file transfer** — a 500 KB file chunked → reassembled by offset → byte-verified. All exercise
  the SAME product logic (secure_link → ConnectionService/ConnectionManager → MeshNode →
  EncryptedTransport / FileChannel) over the real POSIX WS transport.
- Implemented + unit-tested: all core logic + crypto (AES-256-GCM / ECDH P-256 / SHA / HMAC /
  HKDF / base64, KAT-verified), pairing + secure-link handshake, the protocol/codec layer, the
  mesh brain (N-peer switch, coordinator failover, heartbeat fail-safe, clipboard sync, input
  forwarding, one-time drop/return/unavailable/version toasts), `ConnectionService`, the
  file-transfer session + `FileChannel`, WoL `WakeFlow`, and the config store. Both Windows
  (Shell_NotifyIcon) and macOS (NSStatusBar) are real tray apps; the Windows tray has the mesh,
  hotkey+fallback, picker, clipboard, WoL, an opt-in run-on-startup toggle, a working Settings
  item, **auto-discovery pairing** (LAN beacon → pick device by name+IP, no manual IP typing),
  **native file copy/paste** (delay-render IDataObject → on-demand encrypted /files channel), and
  a **file debug log** (`%APPDATA%\Skittermouse\log.txt`); macOS has the Carbon hotkey + NSPanel
  picker. **Windows WS transport is plain WS** (transport TLS removed as redundant with app-layer
  AES-256-GCM; pairing gated by the 6-digit numeric comparison); POSIX WS transport (macOS/Linux)
  still does TLS, so align the two before any Windows<->macOS pairing.
- Remaining items are **macOS-only** (see the **macOS** section below); the **Windows product is
  feature-complete**. Two field bugs were just fixed + CI-green:
  (1) one-way discovery when a **VPN** is up — the beacon now sends to every interface's directed
  broadcast, so the LAN NIC is always covered regardless of the default route; (2) the installer
  now opens the app's firewall ports, stops a running instance before reinstall, and the app has a
  single-instance guard so two copies never fight over the fixed ports.

## VERY IMPORTANT — native C++ only (product); OpenSSL only in the Linux test rig

Every SHIPPED item must use **native, system-provided C++ APIs only** — Win32, WinSock2,
CNG/BCrypt, Schannel, Core Graphics, AppKit, CommonCrypto, Security.framework, BSD sockets, and
the C++ standard library. **No third-party dependencies in the product** (spec §16). The ONE
exception is `src/platform/crypto_posix.cpp` + `tools/net*.cpp`: they link OpenSSL, but they are
the Linux two-container TEST RIG only (`tests/docker/`) and are never compiled into the
Windows/macOS product (guarded by the CMake `else()`/`UNIX AND NOT APPLE` branches).

---

## Remaining — cross-platform / Windows

### Run-after-install — diagnose from the log first, then fix

- The release-publish step was broken (403) so earlier fixes weren't reaching your PC — that's fixed
  now, so grab the **newest** nightly. Real fixes shipping: the installer **kills any running
  instance during install** (before the finish-page "Run" launches the new one) so a stale/zombie
  copy from a prior build can't block it, plus a cross-integrity single-instance mutex.
- **Diagnose before guessing** — the log is the source of truth. After clicking Finish, open
  `%APPDATA%\Skittermouse\log.txt`:
  - `[app] runTrayApp entry` **present** → the exe started; the problem is downstream (tray/hotkey) —
    send me the lines that follow.
  - `[app] another instance already running` → a copy is already in the tray (not a bug).
  - **No log at all** → the process never started. Run the exe directly from the portable
    `Skittermouse-Windows-x64.zip`; Windows shows the real reason (a missing DLL, SmartScreen, or AV
    quarantine of an unsigned exe). Only THEN pick a targeted fix (e.g. bundle just the VC++ redist,
    or code-sign — NOT static-linking the whole CRT, which needlessly bloats the exe).

### One-way LAN discovery — unicast reply (verify corp ↔ home)

- Root fix: because your corp PC already RECEIVES your desktop's broadcast (that's why it sees the
  desktop), each machine now **unicasts its beacon straight back to any beacon it receives**. So the
  moment ONE direction's broadcast gets through, BOTH machines see each other — bypassing whatever
  drops the corp PC's outbound broadcast (VPN split routing / corp firewall / WiFi client isolation).
  This is on top of the per-interface broadcast + inbound/outbound firewall rules.
- Workaround meanwhile: open **Add device** on both, then **initiate the pair from the corp PC**,
  which already sees your desktop. If it still fails after the newest nightly, the corp endpoint
  firewall is dropping the app's UDP entirely (allow Skittermouse there, or pair over the same LAN
  without the VPN).

### Lock-screen unlock — runtime open question (§14)

- Unlock is switch-then-type only (no scripted credentials). **Verify on a real locked Windows
  machine** whether `SendInput`-forwarded keystrokes cross the Secure Desktop / `LogonUI`
  boundary; if they don't, unlock needs physical presence at that machine (an OS limitation, not a
  bug). `lock_win` / `lock_mac`, autostart, and the WoL "Waking…" flow are all done.

---

## macOS — needs a Mac to write + validate against the live Cocoa/keychain runtime

Everything _above_ the transport (mesh, pairing, discovery, file channel, clipboard, WoL,
election) is cross-platform and already unit-tested + Docker-proven; only the macOS OS-glue below
remains. The Windows side interops only over `wss`, so all of this must speak TLS.

**Landed (compiles on macOS CI):** `platform/ws_transport_mac.mm` — a native BSD-socket +
SecureTransport `wss` transport mirroring the validated OpenSSL/Schannel structure. Its hardest
piece, minting the ephemeral self-signed server identity, rests on `crypto/x509_selfsigned` — a
pure-logic DER cert builder **unit-tested and byte-verified on Windows** (CryptoAPI parses AND
self-verifies its output), so the cert bytes SecureTransport consumes are known-correct.

- [~] `platform/ws_transport_mac.mm` — validate the SecureTransport/keychain runtime path
  (SecKeyCreateRandomKey / temporary keychain / SecIdentityCreateWithCertificate / SSLHandshake)
  on a real Mac. Compiles on CI; same footing Schannel had before its two-machine run.
- [ ] Tray networking in `platform/tray_mac.mm`: background connect/accept → secure-link → mesh
      I/O thread, the NSTimer mesh pump, auto-discovery + the `NSAlert` pairing confirm — a direct
      port of the done Windows tray. `ConnectionManager` / `MeshNode` / `secure_link` /
      `PairingExchange` / discovery are all cross-platform + tested; only the Cocoa threading/UI
      glue is new.
- [ ] `platform/filepromise_mac.mm` (`NSFilePromiseProvider`) — native Finder progress (§9.2). The
      mesh announce, the `/files` secure channel, and `net/FileChannel` are cross-platform + done;
      only the macOS OS-provider glue remains.

## Manual validation

The code is built + CI-green, but these paths need real hardware — validate on your machines.

### Two Windows machines — pair, connect, forward input (Step 9, built)

1. Install the same nightly on both PCs; both show the tray icon.
2. Same LAN. The installer now **auto-adds the Windows Firewall rules** (TCP 47800-47803, UDP
   47802); on a corp/domain PC where policy blocks that, allow Skittermouse manually.
3. On BOTH PCs: tray → **Add device**. Each PC broadcasts its presence (now out **every** network
   interface, so a VPN on one PC no longer hides it) and shows a live list of devices (name + IP).
4. On ONE PC, select the other from the list → **Pair**. (The other PC just needs its Add-device
   window open; it accepts automatically.)
5. Both show a **6-digit code** — confirm they MATCH and click Yes on both → toast "Paired with …".
6. Within a few seconds → toast "Connected to <PC>"; the peer appears in the tray menu.
7. Click the peer (or hotkey → pick it) to switch input, then type/move → it appears on the other
   PC; switch back with the hotkey/menu. (This is exactly the flow the Docker rig proves headless.)

- Not connecting? Check the firewall, that both are on the same LAN, and that both run the same
  build. The `%APPDATA%\Skittermouse\log.txt` file logs each dial/accept/pair/TLS step.

### Two Windows machines — copy/paste a file (Step 10, built)

1. Pair + connect two PCs as above; allow TCP 47803 (the /files channel) through the firewall.
2. On PC-A: copy a file (or several) in Explorer (Ctrl+C).
3. On PC-B: paste (Ctrl+V) into any folder → Explorer shows its own copy-progress dialog while the
   bytes stream from PC-A over the encrypted /files channel; the files land byte-for-byte.
4. Mid-transfer failure (e.g. PC-A goes offline) surfaces as Explorer's own native copy-error
   dialog. `log.txt` logs `[file] announced/serving/pulling` on each side.

- Directories are skipped in v1 (files only). One transfer at a time.

### Run-on-startup installer checkbox (Step 13)

- Install with "Run Skittermouse on startup" ticked → after reboot the tray reappears.
- Default (unticked) → no autostart; enable later via tray "Run on startup" or Settings.
- "Run Skittermouse" on the installer's finish page launches it immediately (elevated, from the
  elevated installer). If a previous copy was running, the reinstall now stops it first and the
  single-instance guard prevents two copies fighting over the ports.

### Lock-screen unlock (Step 14, open question)

- Switch to a LOCKED PC and type its password through forwarded input. Verify whether SendInput
  crosses the Secure Desktop (LogonUI) boundary on your Windows build; if not, unlock needs
  physical presence (documented limitation, not a bug).

## Do NOT build (spec §1 non-goals — listed so they aren't accidentally added)

- Linux support in the PRODUCT (the Linux build is a TEST RIG only, never shipped).
- Edge-of-screen crossing as a primary/load-bearing switch trigger.
- Remote desktop, screen streaming, video capture.
- A Bluetooth backend now (keep only the `transport.h` abstraction).

## Evaluate the below - don't implement yet

- Rich clipboard formats (images/RTF/HTML) — plain text only v1.
- Resumable/queued file transfers — one at a time, fail cleanly.
- Any unattended/scripted credential injection into a lock screen.
